Integrating LLMs into production systems is very different from experimenting in a notebook. Here are patterns I've learned building real systems.

## Production Patterns

1. Fallback chains
2. Cost management via caching and batching
3. Prompt engineering as code

## Error Handling

Expect hallucinations, inconsistent output, rate limits, and timeouts. Build robust monitoring and retries.
