Co-founding QFI Research Capital while working full-time at Adaequare taught me more about entrepreneurship than any book or course ever could.

## The Reality Check

It's late nights after your day job, weekends spent debugging, and constant context switching between two demanding roles.

## What I Learned

### Time Management is Critical
Ruthless prioritization. Mornings for architecture and system design, evenings for implementation, weekends for deep work.

### Choose Your Co-founders Wisely
Divide responsibilities clearly and trust each other to execute.

### Technical Debt vs Speed
Done is better than perfect, but know when to invest in quality.

## The Platform

Microservices with Kafka, PostgreSQL + InfluxDB, and real-time risk engines.

## Key Takeaway

Entrepreneurship while employed is possible, but it requires sacrifice, discipline, and a burning desire to build something meaningful.
