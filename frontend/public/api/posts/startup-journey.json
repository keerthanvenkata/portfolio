Mornings for architecture and system design, evenings for implementation, weekends for deep work.</p>\n<h3>Choose Your Co-founders Wisely</h3>\n<p>Divide responsibilities clearly and trust each other to execute.</p>\n<h3>Technical Debt vs Speed</h3>\n<p>Done is better than perfect, but know when to invest in quality.</p>\n<h2>The Platform</h2>\n<p>Microservices with Kafka, PostgreSQL + InfluxDB, and real-time risk engines.</p>\n<h2>Key Takeaway</h2>\n<p>Entrepreneurship while employed is possible, but it requires sacrifice, discipline, and a burning desire to build something meaningful.</p>\n"
