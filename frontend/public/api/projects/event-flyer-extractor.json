  "title": "Event Flyer Extraction System",
  "role": "Author & Maintainer",
  "description": "Production-ready AI system that extracts structured event metadata from flyer images using Gemini Vision. Processes JPG/PNG to extract 11 event fields (name, date, venue, organizer, etc.) with validation and human-in-the-loop review. Built as a streamlined, domain-specific adaptation of the Contract Data Extraction Service.",
  "contribution": "Architected and deployed a production-optimized extraction system that adapts proven patterns from enterprise contract extraction into a cost-effective event intelligence platform.",
  "contributionBullets": [
    "Adapted template-based validation from contract extraction for event-specific metadata (11 core fields).",
    "Implemented Gemini Vision-based extraction (Flash for cost efficiency while keeping accuracy on image content).",
    "Built two-tier validation: Python datatype checks plus LLM-based quality assessment with 13 confidence flags.",
    "Designed SQLite-based job tracking for simplicity and zero-ops (inspired by contract extraction DB patterns).",
    "Created external prompt management so non-technical users can iterate on extraction rules without code changes.",
    "Developed Streamlit UI for human review and approval workflows, aligned with contract extraction review interface.",
    "Integrated Google Drive polling (cron) for automated batch ingestion from client sources.",
    "Built JSONL export for downstream integration (Google Sheets, booking platforms).",
    "Centralized logging and configuration patterns from contract extraction.",
    "Deployed with minimal infrastructure: local scripts plus optional FastAPI, scaled for ~1,000 images/month."
