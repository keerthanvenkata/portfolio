  "details": "I built this trading bot primarily to verify quantitative assumptions and get a better understanding of market dynamics. It's not meant for live trading or production use, but rather as a learning tool to test strategies, understand backtesting methodologies, and explore how different market conditions affect trading algorithms. The bot includes real-time data processing, backtesting framework, and execution capabilities to validate theoretical approaches with real market data.",
