  "details": "While working on QFI we built this bot as an internal sandbox to verify quantitative assumptions, test strategies, and validate backtesting methodologies before and alongside the main platform. It shares the same event-driven ideas and stack: real-time market data via Kafka, OHLCV aggregation into InfluxDB, and execution via Kite Connect. The goal was to run experiments and understand market dynamics without affecting production, and to inform design decisions for the institutional platform. That’s why it stays unlinked—it was internal tooling, not a shipped product.",
