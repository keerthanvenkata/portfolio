  "description": "Enterprise data transformation system automating tax roll data matching across 3,000+ counties. A hybrid AI‑assisted two‑layer matching approach maps diverse county formats to standardized schemas, reducing analyst workload while preserving high accuracy.",
  "contribution": "Designed and delivered the hybrid AI‑assisted transformation platform end‑to‑end.",
  "contributionBullets": [
    "Two‑layer matching: Heuristics (token fuzzy, Jaccard, datatype scoring) + Gemini semantic matching on sampled values.",
    "Experimented with different matching algorithms and models to improve accuracy and recall.",
    "Built a feedback loop where analyst corrections improve future processing.",
    "Exposed FastAPI routers to orchestrate OCR/LLM flows as well as ETL pipeline operations.",
    "Target‑based architecture with multi‑source transformations and dependency tracking.",
    "Operator‑driven ETL engine: copy, trim, concat, static, arithmetic, and custom functions with full auditability.",
    "Preview mode for rapid QA; seconds vs. minutes for full ETL runs.",
    "React frontend for job management: uploads/merging, status tracking, target‑based review; localStorage + DB sync.",
    "Similarity score pipeline (0–1) integrated DB → API → UI as an analyst decision signal."
