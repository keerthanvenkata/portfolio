  "details": "After building the property appraisal extraction system, I wanted to see if I could generalize the approach for other document types. This project was my attempt to abstract and generalize that work into a reusable framework. The initial idea was to make it easily customizable for different applications, though I didn't end up focusing heavily on that customization aspect. Instead, I focused more on the core extraction pipelines - separate OCR and LLM modules that can be swapped or extended. It's a learning project that helped me understand how to structure document processing systems.",
