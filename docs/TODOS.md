# Project TODOs

Short, high-signal backlog for this portfolio. Keep tasks grouped by theme; strike through or move to “Done” when finished.

## Site Experience

- [ ] Add shimmering starfield layer (subtle, low-density) behind hero and cards.
- [ ] Revisit experimental modal visuals to exactly match project modal polish.
- [ ] Implement keyboard-accessible theme toggle with two distinct designs (dark: spark↔sun, bright: sun↔moon). Dual placement: top-right below header + sidebar bottom above socials.
- [ ] Add query param + persisted preference for bright/professional mode.
- [ ] Design toggle labels/tooltips: "Professional Mode" (dark) vs "Personal Lab" (bright) with appropriate descriptions.
- [ ] (Optional) Life section: implement `/life` with in-page sections and own theme (see `docs/life-section-plan.md`). No theme-based content filtering; dark/light show same content.
- [ ] Review mobile navigation gestures after latest sidebar changes.
- [ ] Redesign VK logo variant that works for both dark neon and bright professional themes.

## Content & Docs

- [ ] Fill About/Blog/Experimental copy gaps (use latest resume context).
- [ ] Curate travel shorts + entrepreneurial write-ups for homepage highlights.
- [ ] Document starfield + glow tokens once implemented (style guide update).
- [ ] Create walkthrough video/gif for recruiters (embed in bright mode landing).

## Performance & Tooling

- [ ] Add bundle analyzer target + CI check.
- [ ] Evaluate image compression workflow (PNG→WebP for heavy assets).
- [ ] Consider preloading hero portrait variants to avoid flash when switching.

## Done

- [x] Responsive sidebar hover/pin logic refinements.
- [x] Portrait slot redesign + PNG transparency guidance.
- [x] Documentation refresh (README, style guide, master plan, professional mode spec).
