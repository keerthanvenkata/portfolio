# Project TODOs

Short, high-signal backlog for this portfolio. Keep tasks grouped by theme; strike through or move to “Done” when finished.

## Site Experience

- [ ] Add shimmering starfield layer (subtle, low-density) behind hero and cards.
- [ ] Revisit experimental modal visuals to exactly match project modal polish.
- [ ] Implement keyboard-accessible theme toggle (dark default, bright optional).
- [ ] Add query param + persisted preference for bright/professional mode.
- [ ] Review mobile navigation gestures after latest sidebar changes.

## Content & Docs

- [ ] Fill About/Blog/Experimental copy gaps (use latest resume context).
- [ ] Curate travel shorts + entrepreneurial write-ups for homepage highlights.
- [ ] Document starfield + glow tokens once implemented (style guide update).
- [ ] Create walkthrough video/gif for recruiters (embed in bright mode landing).

## Performance & Tooling

- [ ] Add bundle analyzer target + CI check.
- [ ] Evaluate image compression workflow (PNG→WebP for heavy assets).
- [ ] Consider preloading hero portrait variants to avoid flash when switching.

## Done

- [x] Responsive sidebar hover/pin logic refinements.
- [x] Portrait slot redesign + PNG transparency guidance.
- [x] Documentation refresh (README, style guide, master plan, professional mode spec).
